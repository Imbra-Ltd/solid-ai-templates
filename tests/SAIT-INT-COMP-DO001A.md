## Short description

> **Given** a concrete stack template with a multi-level DEPENDS ON chain
> **When** an agent loads the stack template and all its declared dependencies
> **Then** every rule from every template in the chain is present in the
> assembled rule set and no rule is silently dropped

## Results

| Result | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| PASSED | All sections from all templates in the dependency chain appear in the assembled output; no section is missing |
| FAILED | One or more sections from a parent template are absent from the assembled output |
| SKIPPED | No agent available to run the assembly |
| BLOCKED | `SAIT-SMOKE-SYS-FS001A` is failing — DEPENDS ON paths do not resolve |
| ERROR | Agent fails to load or process the template files |

## Steps

### Prerequisites

- Repository cloned locally
- Claude Code or equivalent agent available
- `stack/python-flask.md` and its full dependency chain accessible:
  `stack/python-lib.md`, `stack/python-service.md`, `base/git.md`,
  `base/docs.md`, `base/quality.md`, `backend/config.md`, `backend/http.md`,
  `backend/database.md`, `backend/observability.md`, `backend/quality.md`,
  `backend/features.md`, `backend/messaging.md`

### Setup

1. Open Claude Code in the repository root
2. Attach `stack/python-flask.md` to the conversation

### Execution

1. Ask the agent:
   ```
   List every template in the full DEPENDS ON chain for stack/python-flask.md,
   then list every section heading that will appear in the assembled rule set.
   ```
2. Record the list of templates and sections returned

### Assertions

1. Assert the dependency chain includes all of the following:
   - `stack/python-lib.md`
   - `stack/python-service.md`
   - `base/git.md`, `base/docs.md`, `base/quality.md`
   - `backend/config.md`, `backend/http.md`, `backend/database.md`
   - `backend/observability.md`, `backend/quality.md`
   - `backend/features.md`, `backend/messaging.md`
2. Assert section headings from every template in the chain are present
3. Assert no template in the chain is referenced but not loaded

### Teardown

— (read-only check, no teardown required)
