## Short description

> **Given** the repository is cloned and all template files are present
> **When** every `[DEPENDS ON: ...]` header in every stack template is read
> **Then** each listed file path resolves to an existing file in the repository

## Results

| Result | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| PASSED | Every path listed in every `[DEPENDS ON: ...]` header exists as a file in the repository |
| FAILED | One or more paths listed in a `[DEPENDS ON: ...]` header do not resolve to an existing file |
| SKIPPED | Repository cannot be cloned or accessed |
| BLOCKED | — |
| ERROR | File system is inaccessible; `find` or equivalent tool fails |

## Steps

### Prerequisites

- Repository cloned locally
- Shell access with `grep` and file listing tools available

### Setup

1. Change to the repository root
2. Confirm the `stack/` directory is present

### Execution

1. Extract all `[DEPENDS ON: ...]` lines from every file in `stack/`:
   ```bash
   grep -r "DEPENDS ON" stack/
   ```
2. For each file path listed in the extracted lines, verify the file exists:
   ```bash
   # Example: verify stack/go-service.md depends resolve
   ls stack/go-lib.md backend/config.md backend/http.md
   ```
3. Repeat for every stack file

### Assertions

1. Assert every path extracted from `[DEPENDS ON: ...]` exists in the repository
2. Assert no path is a directory — all references must point to `.md` files

### Teardown

— (read-only check, no teardown required)

## Notes

Semi-manual because no automated parser for `[DEPENDS ON: ...]` exists yet.
A future CI step should automate this check using `manifest.yaml` as the
source of truth.
